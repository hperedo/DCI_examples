## Middleware

- A function that handles an incoming request or passes it to another function

  - A middleware function can send a response
  - A middleware function can edit the request
  - A middleware function can stop or continue the processing of a request


- All of our endpoint functions are technically middleware functions too!

```js

  app.get("/users", (req, res) => {
    res.send("Users endpoint here")
  })

```

- We can use middleware

  - For requests to a specific method and path
  - For all requests 


- Usually middleware functions are added for all methods at once


```js
 // For all request methods (GET, POST...) to *any* path
    app.use((req, res, next) => {
      // do something
        
      next() // continue processing request in the next middleware
    })


 // For all request methods (GET, POST...) to a specific path ("/users")
    app.use("/users", (req, res, next) => {
      // do something
      next() // continue processing request in the next middleware
    })



```

- When reading/writing middleware, the order counts!
  - Middleware that was declared ("used") first, will run first
  - If a middleware stops processing a request, the next middleware will not run


- Middleware callback function signature: `(req, res, next) => { ... }`


## Handling Errors

- We can have a global error handling middleware
  - It needs to be the very last middleware, though!

- Global Error handling middleware signature: 
  - `(err, req, res, next) => { ... }`

  - We would get to that middleware if we call `next()` and give it a value

  - Such as


 ```js

  app.get("/users", (req, res, next) => {
    next()
  })

  app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    console.error("Global Error Handler received an error!", err)
    res.send({ message: err.message })
  })

  ```
