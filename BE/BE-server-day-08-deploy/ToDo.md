## Express & React
    - combine express with React
        Dev Mode:
            - set proxy in React
            - understand `cors` middleware in express.
        - Production 
            - understand the Difference between express routes & react routes.
            - set static files/folders in express.


## Deploy a fullstack web app 
    - In Real hosting machine (real server).
    - In Render 


## Notes
- create react app directly without project name:
    `npx create-react-app .`
- In `package.json` in frontend: add `"proxy": "http://localhost:5000"`
    just telling react where is my backend running
