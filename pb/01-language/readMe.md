## what is a programing language? ##


> A programming language is a computer language that is used by programmers (developers) to communicate with computers. It is a set of instructions >  written in any specific language ( C, C++, Java, Python ,JavaScript) to perform a specific task.

> before chrome, safari, mozila, even internet explorer, in the beggining there was Mosaic 
> this guy cretaed NetScape NAvigator => in 1990's    => a war between netscape and internet explorer and the result was death of netscape 
> which ended all or most of the features are used in firfox nowdays  (its the days that windows 98 was introduced)

now explain how was searhing , doing things in server and sending back what user wanted  +>> removing server to do all in browesr => 

and a guys name Brendan Eich

> - Brendan Eich created Javascript in 10 days  ( for more info google it :) )




> Brendan first didnt call javascript he named it liveScript and microsoft reveresed engineered that and they named it JScript ( some different js > language created and it was somehow  a mess) then europian decided to standarize this language and they called it ECMAScript
> which stands for European Computer Manufacturers Association Script.


> so if u hear ES6 OR ES7 its coming from EcmaSCript (which is the  javascript )

### why they call it javaScript? ### 

> its like actor scripts that they read some scrip and and they memorize it and act  according the script 

###  is it the same like java ?  are java and javascript the same ?###


> NOPE! not at all its like if u compare car and carpet and because they start with car then they are same :D




> they are different languages , interpreted vs compiled

## what is interpreted and compiled languages ? ##

> A compiled language is a programming language whose implementations are typically compilers and not interpreters. An interpreted language is a

> programming language whose implementations execute instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language


> or more simple : 

> Interpreter translates just one statement of the program at a time into machine code. Compiler scans the entire program and translates the whole
> of it into machine code at once
