# Responding to events

- react lets you add event handlers to your JSX
- event handlers are functions that responds to events such as click, hover etc
- By convention, it is common to name event handlers as handle followed by the event name. Youâ€™ll often see onClick={handleClick}, onMouseEnter={handleMouseEnter}, and so on.
- because eevent handlers are declared inside of a component, they have access to the componet's props
