# SPA - Boilerplate


## Introduction: SPA?

- SPA === Single Page Application
- Building web things is expensive (time/money)
  - Faster to build = good
  - SPAs are fast to build


- SPAs can be (in theory) faster


  - Web apps (facebook, insta...) usually have parts of the page that don't really change

    - Reloading them every time a part of the page updates is slloooooooow

  - Instead, let's just change the parts of the page that need to change!

  - SPAs are usually made up of components that can be reused

  - Components are easier to understand, maintain and divide work!


- Why not SPA?


  - Significant load on the browser
  - Long running app = more potential for memory leaks
  - SEO can be tricker (I think, I've never really done SEO)


## Framework


- React is a framework


  - It provides tools and mechanisms, it guides ways of working


- Framework obsession: Overview of the JS Framework landscape

  - Stable and actually very widely used in industry
  - Allows for easier transition to mobile apps with React Native

  - Fairly straightforward to learn, but still powerful and extensible

  - Backed by Facebook = not going away soon

  - Lots of documentation and examples!
